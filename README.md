## Data Exploration & Cleaning

- Displayed dataset overview using:
  - `df.head()`
  - `df.tail()`
  - `df.shape`
  - `df.info()`
  - `df.describe()`

- **Cleaning Steps**:
  - Checked for and dropped all missing values: `df.dropna(inplace=True)`
  - Removed duplicate entries: `df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)`
  - Type casting:
    - Converted `id` to `int64`
    - Converted `rating` to numeric

##  Univariate Analysis

- **Price Distribution**:
  ```python
  sns.histplot(data=df, x='price')
  sns.boxplot(data=df, x='price')
  ```

- **Outlier Removal**:
  - Filtered prices under $1500 for more meaningful analysis
  - Used histograms and boxplots on filtered data

- **Improved Price Distribution Plot**:
  - Customized with title, axis labels, and currency format

  ```python
    # Filtered Price Distribution 

    sns.histplot(data=df_price, x='price',bins=55)
    sns.despine()
    plt.title('Price Distribution')
    plt.xlabel('Price')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    formatter = ticker.FormatStrFormatter('$%1.0f')
    plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
    plt.show()   
  ```
- **Result**:

  ![Filtered Price Distribution](images/PriceDistribution.png)

    *Histogram showing Price Distribution of different AirBnB listing in NewYork*

- **Insights**:

  - **Right-Skewed Distribution**: The majority of Airbnb listings are priced below $300, with frequency dropping as price increases.
  - **Most Common Price Range**: Most listings fall between $50 and $200, indicating this is the typical nightly rate.
  - **Few High-Priced Listings**: Listings above $500 are rare, and those above $1000 are very uncommon, suggesting luxury listings are limited.
  - **Potential Outliers**: The long right tail highlights the presence of outliers with exceptionally high prices.
  - **Market Accessibility**: The concentration of lower-priced listings suggests Airbnb in New York is accessible to a wide range of guests.



##  Feature Engineering

- Grouped mean price by `neighbourhood_group`
- Created new column:
  ```python
  df_price['price per bed'] = df_price['price'] / df['beds']
  ```

- Calculated average price per bed per neighborhood group:
    ```python
    # Mean price per bed
    df_price.groupby(by='neighbourhood_group')['price per bed'].mean()
    ```

  | Neighbourhood Group | Mean Price per Bed ($) |
  |---------------------|-----------------------|
  | Bronx               | 74.71                 |
  | Brooklyn            | 99.79                 |
  | Manhattan           | 138.71                |
  | Queens              | 76.34                 |
  | Staten Island       | 67.73                 |

## Bivariate Analysis

### 1. Price vs Neighbourhood & Room Type

  ```python
    sns.barplot(data=df_price,x='neighbourhood_group', y='price', hue='room_type')
    sns.despine()
    plt.title('Price dependency on neighbourhood by roomtype')
    plt.xlabel('Neighbourhood')
    plt.ylabel('Price')
    formatter = ticker.FormatStrFormatter('$%1.0f')
    plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
    plt.show()
  ```
- **Result**:

  ![Price vs Neighbourhood & Room Type](images/Price_dependency_on_neighbourhood_and_roomtype.png)

    *Barplot showing the price vs neighbourhood and roomtype*

- **Insights**:

    - **Manhattan is the most expensive** for all room types, especially hotel rooms and entire homes/apartments.
    - **Entire home/apartment listings** are the priciest in every neighbourhood.
    - **Shared rooms** are the most affordable option across all boroughs.
    - **Brooklyn and Queens** offer mid-range prices, while **Bronx and Staten Island** are the most budget-friendly.

### 2. Reviews vs Price
  - Filtered listings with `number_of_reviews > 250`
  - Scatter plot with hue as `neighbourhood_group`

  ```python
    # Scatterplot visualizing the number of reviews and relative price 

    # Filtering
    df_reviews = df_price[df_price['number_of_reviews'] >250 ]
    sns.scatterplot(data=df_reviews, x='number_of_reviews',     y='price', hue='neighbourhood_group')
    sns.despine()
    plt.title("Locality and Review Dependency")
    plt.ylabel('Price')
    plt.xlabel('Number of reviews')
    formatter = ticker.FormatStrFormatter('$%1.0f')
    plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
    plt.show()
  ```
- **Result**:

  ![Price vs Neighbourhood & Room Type](images/Number_of_reviews_per_locality_and_respective%20prices.png)

    *Scatterplot visualizing the number of reviews and relative prices by neighbourhood*

- **Insights**:

    - **Inverse Relationship:** Listings with a higher number of reviews tend to have lower prices, suggesting affordable options are more popular and frequently booked.
    - **Manhattan Outliers:** Some high-priced Manhattan listings still receive many reviews, indicating strong demand for premium locations.
    - **Brooklyn and Queens:** Most high-review, low-price listings are concentrated in Brooklyn and Queens, making them attractive for budget travelers.
    - **Few Expensive Listings with Many Reviews:** Very few listings above $500 have a large number of reviews, highlighting that luxury stays are less commonly booked.

### 3. Rating vs Price

    - 2D density heatmap (KDE) to visualize the relationship   between ratings and their prices, focusing on more affordable and higher-rated listings.
  - Filtered listings with `price < 500` and `rating >= 4.5`
  - KDE plot:

    ```python
    df_filtered = df_price[(df_price['price'] < 500) & (df_price['rating'] >= 4.5)]

    sns.kdeplot(
        data=df_filtered,
        x="rating", y="price",
        cmap="viridis", fill=True, thresh=0.05
    )
    sns.despine()
    plt.title("Density Heatmap: Rating vs. Price")
    plt.xlabel("Rating")
    plt.ylabel("Price")
    plt.gca().invert_yaxis() 
    formatter = ticker.FormatStrFormatter('$%1.0f')
    plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)
    plt.show()
    ```
- **Result**:

  ![2D density heatmap for relationship between ratings and prices](images/Density_heatmap.png)

    *2D density heatmap to visualize the relationship  between ratings and their prices*

- **Insights**:

    - **High ratings cluster at lower prices:** Most top-rated listings (â‰¥4.8) are found at lower price points.
    - **Affordable stays get better ratings:** Listings under $200 tend to receive the highest ratings.
    - **Few expensive, highly rated listings:** Premium, high-rated listings are rare.
    - **Value drives satisfaction:** Guest satisfaction is closely linked to affordability.

## Value for Money Listings

- **Filtering:** Selected listings with `rating > 4.5` and `price < $500` as "value-for-money" options.
- **Aggregation:** Grouped by `neighbourhood_group` and `room_type` to count qualifying listings.
- **Sorting:** Neighbourhoods ordered by total count of value-for-money listings.

```python
# Filter listings by rating > 4.5 and price < 500
df_filtered = df_price[(df_price['rating'] > 4.5) & (df_price['price'] < 500)]

# Group by neighbourhood and room type, then count
counts = df_filtered.groupby(['neighbourhood_group', 'room_type']).size().reset_index(name='count')

# Total counts per neighbourhood to sort by
neighbourhood_order = counts.groupby('neighbourhood_group')['count'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).index

# Plotting
sns.barplot(
    data=counts,
    x='neighbourhood_group',
    y='count',
    hue='room_type',
    order=neighbourhood_order
)
sns.despine()
plt.title('Count of Value-for-Money Listings by Neighbourhood and Room Type')
plt.xlabel('Neighbourhood Group')
plt.ylabel('Number of Listings')
plt.show()
```

- **Result:**

  ![Value for Money Listings](images/Value_for_Money_Listings.png)

  *Barplot showing the count of value-for-money listings by neighbourhood and room type*

- **Insights:**
  - **Brooklyn and Manhattan** have the highest number of value-for-money listings.
  - **Entire home/apartment** and **private rooms** are the most common value-for-money options across all neighbourhoods.
  - **Queens and Bronx** also offer a significant number of affordable, highly rated listings.
  - **Staten Island** has the fewest value-for-money listings overall.

## Geographical Distribution of Airbnb Listings

- **Visualization:** Scatter plot of listings by longitude and latitude, colored by `room_type`.
- **Purpose:** Shows the spatial spread and concentration of different room types across New York City.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='longitude', y='latitude', hue='room_type')
plt.title("Geographical Distribution of AirBnb Listing")
plt.xlabel('Longitude')
plt.ylabel('Latitude')
plt.show()
```

- **Result:**

  ![Geographical Distribution](images/Geographical_Distribution.png)

  *Scatter plot showing the geographical distribution of Airbnb listings by room type*

- **Insights:**
  - **Listings are densely clustered** in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with sparser distribution in Staten Island.
  - **Entire home/apartment** and **private room** types dominate across all boroughs.
  - **Hotel and shared rooms** are less common and more scattered.
  - **Room types are well distributed** throughout the city, but premium locations (Manhattan) have higher listing density.

---

## Correlation Heatmap

- **Visualization:** Heatmap of correlations between key numerical variables.
- **Purpose:** Identifies relationships between price, reviews, availability, and other features.

```python
corr = df[['latitude', 'longitude', 'price', 'minimum_nights', 'number_of_reviews', 'reviews_per_month', 'availability_365', 'beds']].corr()

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(data=corr, annot=True)
plt.show()
```

- **Result:**

  ![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation.png)

  *Heatmap showing correlation between numerical features in the dataset*

- **Insights:**
  - **Number of reviews** and **reviews per month** are strongly correlated.
  - **Price** has weak correlation with most variables, indicating other factors may influence pricing.
  - **Latitude and longitude** show minimal correlation with other features.
  - **Beds** has a slight positive correlation with price, as expected.

## Recommendations

- **For Guests:**
  - Consider booking in Brooklyn or Queens for the best balance of price, quality, and availability.
  - Look for listings with high ratings and a large number of reviews for a more reliable experience.
  - Private rooms and entire apartments offer the most value-for-money options in most neighborhoods.

- **For Hosts:**
  - Competitive pricing and maintaining high ratings are key to attracting more bookings.
  - Enhancing guest experience in affordable listings can lead to higher ratings and more reviews.
  - Hosts in Manhattan and Brooklyn can leverage location advantages but should monitor pricing to remain competitive.

- **For Airbnb Platform:**
  - Highlight value-for-money listings to budget-conscious travelers.
  - Encourage hosts in underrepresented areas (like Staten Island) to improve listing quality and visibility.
